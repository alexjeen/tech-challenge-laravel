# Dataswitcher tech challenge in Laravel

You should be able to complete these challenges in around 4 hours. There is no specific order you need to execute the tests in.

All of this stuff should work via Laravel Sail CLI, read more about that here:

https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail

No need to make any view (html) solutions for this.

## Getting started

1. Install Docker on your machine
2. Clone this repository
3. Go to the directory of the project (cd tech-challenge-laravel)
4. Execute the command ./vendor/bin/sail up
